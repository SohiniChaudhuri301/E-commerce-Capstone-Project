# E-commerce-Capstone-Project
ElecKart is a leading e-commerce chain based in Ontario, Canada, specialising in electronic products. It sells all major electronic items such as TVs, cameras, OLED screens, and microwaves. The company follows the marketplace model and acts as a platform where buyers and sellers can interact with each other. Sellers can put various products on the website, and buyers purchase these products from them. The company serves as a technology provider for a free but regulated marketplace and deals with all the top-end and low-end brands to cater to different types of customers.     The company has a huge network across the country and has partnered with multiple courier companies to deliver their products to customers in every possible corner of the country. It sells these products only via the website and occasionally offers big-ticket promotions (similar to the Big Billion Day) in order to ensure that the top-end customers are delighted. The company has established several quality checks to ensure the timely delivery of the products and notify the end customers of each intermediate step till the final product is delivered to their doorstep. Detailed feedback is also requested on the products and services in order to further improve customer experience.
